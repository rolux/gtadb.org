# gtadb.org

This is the repository for [gtadb.org](https://gtadb.org).

It includes the source code for [map.gtadb.org](https://map.gtadb.org) – a collaboratively editable map of all landmarks in Grand Theft Auto VI that have been identified so far. If you're looking for a vanilla JavaScript + Python map implementation – no external JS libraries, and only Flask and Pillow for the backend –, then this may be it.

You're welcome to use the [landmark data](https://map.gtadb.org/data/landmarks.json) or [map tiles](https://github.com/rolux/gtadb.org/tree/main/map/tiles) for your own purposes.
